        <h1>Rice Purity Test: A Fun College Tradition or a Harmful Trend?</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.purityricetestscore.com/">Rice Purity Test</a> has been a part of college culture for decades, originating from Rice University in the 1980s. This 100-question survey is designed to assess the innocence or "purity" of an individual's experiences in various domains such as relationships, crime, and substance use. While some view it as a harmless way to bond and share laughs, others criticize it for promoting peer pressure and potentially harmful behaviors. This article explores both perspectives, delving into the history, structure, and impact of the Rice Purity Test.
